# Day 13: Point of Incidence

## What has to be done

Find the line of reflection in each of the patterns and summarize the pattern notes.

- In part 1, a reflection is defined as perfectly equal lines.
- In part 2, a reflection is defined as lines that can have at most one different element.

## Part 1

### Define the function for parsing the input

- [X] Add failing tests.
- [X] Make the failing tests pass.
- [X] If the part with `Arrange` logic becomes too big, consider breaking down into functions.
- [X] Identify edge cases in the written code and write tests for them.
- [X] Ensure that all newly added functions have docstrings.
- [X] Ensure `git-hook` passes.
- [X] Create your commits. Ensure that each failed test is its own commit and make sure to write the name of the test in the commit message.
- [X] Push.

### Define the method of initializing the class `Summarizer`

- [X] Add failing tests.
- [X] Make the failing tests pass.
- [X] Ensure that all newly added functions have docstrings.
- [X] Ensure `git-hook` passes.
- [X] Create your commits. Ensure that each failed test is its own commit and make sure to write the name of the test in the commit message.
- [X] Push.

### Define a proxy method `summarize` and use it in the function `part1`

- [X] Add failing tests.
- [X] Make the failing tests pass.
- [X] Ensure `git-hook` passes.
- [X] Create your commits. Ensure that each failed test is its own commit and make sure to write the name of the test in the commit message.
- [X] Push.

### Define proxy methods `create_reflection_maps` and `summarize_direction` and use them in `summarize`

- [X] Add failing tests.
- [X] Make the failing tests pass.
- [X] Ensure that all newly added functions have docstrings.
- [X] Ensure `git-hook` passes.
- [X] Create your commits. Ensure that each failed test is its own commit and make sure to write the name of the test in the commit message.
- [X] Push.

### Define the method `create_reflection_maps`

- [X] Add failing tests.
- [X] Make the failing tests pass.
- [X] Identify edge cases in the written code and write tests for them.
- [X] Ensure that all newly added functions have docstrings.
- [X] Ensure `git-hook` passes.
- [X] Create your commits. Ensure that each failed test is its own commit and make sure to write the name of the test in the commit message.
- [X] Push.

### Define proxy methods `summarize_column` and `summarize_row` and use them in `summarize_direction`

- [X] Add failing tests.
- [X] Make the failing tests pass.
- [X] Ensure that all newly added functions have docstrings.
- [X] Ensure `git-hook` passes.
- [X] Create your commits. Ensure that each failed test is its own commit and make sure to write the name of the test in the commit message.
- [X] Push.

### Define the method `summarize_column`

- [X] Add failing tests.
- [X] Make the failing tests pass.
- [X] Ensure that all newly added functions have docstrings.
- [X] Ensure `git-hook` passes.
- [X] Create your commits. Ensure that each failed test is its own commit and make sure to write the name of the test in the commit message.
- [X] Push.

### Define the method `summarize_row`

- [X] Add failing tests.
- [X] Make the failing tests pass.
- [X] Ensure that all newly added functions have docstrings.
- [X] Ensure `git-hook` passes.
- [X] Create your commits. Ensure that each failed test is its own commit and make sure to write the name of the test in the commit message.
- [X] Run on input.
- [X] Push.

## Part 2

### Refactor out the logic for checking reflecting lines in `summarize_column` in a new method: `forms_reflection_column(self, with_smudge: bool=False)`

- [X] Add failing tests.
- [X] Make the failing tests pass.
- [X] Identify edge cases in the written code and write tests for them.
- [X] Ensure that all newly added functions have docstrings.
- [X] Ensure `git-hook` passes.
- [X] Create your commits. Ensure that each failed test is its own commit and make sure to write the name of the test in the commit message.
- [X] Push.

### Refactor out the logic for checking reflecting lines in `summarize_row` in a new method: `forms_reflection_row(self, with_smudge: bool=False)`

### Modify `forms_reflection_column` to work with smudges

### Modify `forms_reflection_row` to work with smudges
