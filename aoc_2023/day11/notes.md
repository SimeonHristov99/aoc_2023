# Day 11: Cosmic Expansion

## What has to be done

Try to solve part 1 naively by doing the steps as they are outlined in the task:

1. Expand the universe.
2. Get all the points.
3. Find the Manhattan distance between them (I think it should be equivalent).

## Create a plan of attack

- [X] Main steps outlined and vision for the end result is written down.

## Expand the input after parsing

### Parse the input

- [X] Add failing tests.
- [X] Make tests pass.
- [X] Look at the code you've written and try to identify any edge cases that are not tested.
- [X] `pre-push` hook passes.
- [X] Commit all changes.

### Expand the universe

- [X] Add failing tests.
- [X] Make tests pass.
- [X] Look at the code you've written and try to identify any edge cases that are not tested.
- [X] `pre-push` hook passes.
- [X] Commit all changes.

## Get all the galaxies as coordinates

- [X] Add failing tests.
- [X] Make tests pass.
- [X] Look at the code you've written and try to identify any edge cases that are not tested.
- [X] `pre-push` hook passes.
- [X] Test that the function `main` reports the number of galaxies found in each input.
- [X] Commit all changes.

## Calculate the Manhattan distance between them

- [X] Add failing tests.
- [X] Make tests pass.
- [X] Look at the code you've written and try to identify any edge cases that are not tested.
- [X] `pre-push` hook passes.
- [X] Commit all changes.

## Working part 1

- [ ] Take the sum of the lengths.
- [ ] Add failing tests.
- [ ] Make tests pass.
- [ ] Look at the code you've written and try to identify any edge cases that are not tested.
- [ ] `pre-push` hook passes.
- [ ] Commit all changes.
- [ ] In case brute force is not enough, brainstorm next steps:
  - [ ] Calculate the Manhattan distance between counting how many special cells.
